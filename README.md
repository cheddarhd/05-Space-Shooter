# 05-Space-Shooter
My first 2d shooter game.

This is a really cool assignment where we are using elements of the past few excercises all in one project. I refferred back to the previous excercises a lot for help on buidling this game. The last one we did with the sample space shoot vs penguins was a huge help in setting up classes and just the basis of the game in general. However I am struggling to get the background image to pop up which I think is what is causing it to run ok but just show black. Going to try and fix it before I turn this in but I struggled to get open color to work correctly so I went with the background image of just space instead. 

EDIT: Fixed background and fixed bullets. Now just need enemies to pop up.

EDIT: Still struggling to use open color to setup score. Tried doing a color code. Also enemies still not popping up I don't know what the issue is.
